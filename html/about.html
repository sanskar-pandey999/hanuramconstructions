        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Hanuram Construction is a budding venture driven by the vision of a passionate founder, SANSKAR PANDEY.
                While the company is yet to embark on its first official project, the foundation is built upon years of
                dedicated experience and a deep-seated commitment to the principles of quality construction and client
                satisfaction.</p>

            <h3 class="writingtwo">Meet the Founder: SANSKAR PANDEY</h3>
            <div class="founder-info">
                <img src="/static/engineer2.jpg" alt="Founder's Image">
                <div class="founder-bio">
                    <p>Beginning his career in construction, Sanskar is enthusiastic about revolutionizing the public's
                        perception of civil engineering and its professionals. This initial exposure ignited a
                        deep-seated passion for the tangible impact of buildingâ€”the power to bring blueprints to life as
                        enduring structures.</p>

                    <p>This passion propelled Sanskar through his schooling at St. Joseph's Convent Senior Secondary
                        School, Sagar, and into his Bachelors and Masters in Civil Engineering at IIT BHU. It was during
                        his fourth year of college that he leveraged this drive, not just for academics, but to launch
                        his own entrepreneurial endeavor.</p>

                    <p>At its core, the vision for Hanuram Construction is to democratize access to quality civil
                        engineering services, enabling everyone to realize their dream residence with unwavering safety
                        and genuine care. We recognize a significant gap where aspiring homeowners lack affordable,
                        expert guidance, and many qualified civil engineers struggle for practical opportunities.
                        Hanuram Construction bridges this gap, creating a supportive ecosystem where engineers can hone
                        their skills by directly addressing customer needs. Sanskar envisions a construction process
                        built on transparency, active collaboration, and a steadfast commitment to delivering
                        exceptional results that truly surpass client expectations.</p>

                    <p>Currently, Sanskar is diligently working on establishing Hanuram Construction's core values and
                        operational framework, focusing on building a robust foundation. His commitment is to launch
                        Hanuram Construction as a symbol of trust, quality, and innovation in the construction sector,
                        particularly here in INDIA.
